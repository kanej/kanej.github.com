About
=====

Hello

I am a programmer hailing from sunny Glasgow in Scotland.

My current interests are around <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> and <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>, but if you want to talk functional programming, philosophy, folk music or hear a 3hr tirade on the evils of Brexit ... get in touch.

You can find me <a href="https://twitter.com/john_kane">on twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kanej">a train wreck of personal projects on GitHub</a> or if you, like me, have a tinfoil hat you can get <a href="https://keybase.io/kanej">in touch via keybase</a> ... but you would be the first.
