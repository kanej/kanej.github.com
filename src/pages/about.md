Hello

I am a programmer hailing from sunny Glasgow in Scotland.

My current interests are around [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org), but if you want to talk functional programming, philosophy, folk music or hear a 3hr tirade on the evils of Brexit ... get in touch.

You can find me [on twitter](https://twitter.com/john_kane), [on GitHub](https://github.com/kanej) or if you, like me, have a tinfoil hat you can get [in touch via keybase](https://keybase.io/kanej) ... but you would be the first.
